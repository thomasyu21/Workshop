- There are multiple ways to implement the same thing
  - Flex and grid can both be used to create the layout of the page (nav on the left, text on the right)
- All three methods of implementing css use the same lines of basic syntax
  - Only thing that changes is the formatting
- Inline css formatting is very messy and hard to read
- Internal and external css separates the css from the html stuff
  - Keeps it cleaner and easier to read
