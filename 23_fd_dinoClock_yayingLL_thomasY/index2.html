        <h3>Control the X-Grid!</h3>
        <div class="grid-x">
            <div class="cell small-4 medium-2 large-5" style="background-color: blue;">
                 Cell 1
             </div>
            <div class="cell small-4 medium-5 large-5" style="background-color: purple;">
                 Cell 2
             </div>
             <div class="cell small-4 medium-5 large-2" style="background-color: pink;">
                 Cell 3
             </div>
           </div>
        Each cell is given a different color to illustrate its boundaries. 
        <br><br>
        <h3>Change Screen Size!</h3>
        Foundation allows you easier change how the site looks depending on the size of the screen: small-sized screen, medium-sized screen, or large-sized screen. 
        <br><br>
        <p style="font-style: italic;"> Try it Yourself! Change your screen size </p>
        You will see that on a small screen, all 3 cells are equally sized, while on the medium screen, the Cell 1 becomes the smaller than the other 2, and on the large screen, Cell 3 becomes the smallest. Cool, right?
        <br><br>
        <h3>Control the Y-Grid!</h3>
        The same can be done vertically!
         <div class="grid-y" style="height:400px">
            <div class="cell small-4 medium-2 large-5" style="background-color: blue;">
                 Cell 1

            <div class="cell small-4 medium-5 large-5" style="background-color: purple;">
                 Cell 2
             </div>
             <div class="cell small-4 medium-5 large-2" style="background-color: pink;">
                 Cell 3

        <p style="font-weight: bold;"> WOW! VERY COOL!</p>

        <h3>Padding</h3>
        Give marigins around your text, so it looks nicer!
        <div class="grid-x grid-padding-x grid-padding-y">

Drink up me hearties yoho …a pirates life for me you know, thats the 2nd time I’v watched that man sail away with my ship. Merchant and pirate were for a long period one and the same person. Even today mercantile morality is really nothing but a refinement of piratical morality. “I’ve got a jar of dirt! I’ve got a jar of dirt, and guess what’s inside it?” “Why is the rum always gone?” How much does the pirate pay for an ear piercing? … A buccaneer!

        <h2>A Nice Example</h2>
        <div class="grid-y medium-grid-frame">
        <div class="cell shrink header medium-cell-block-container">
          <div class="grid-x grid-padding-x">
            <div class="cell medium-4" style="background-color: aquamarine;">
              This text was made using cell medium-4 medium-cell-block-y. THere are 12 columns.  The 4 indicates it will take up 4 of them
            </div>
            <div class="cell medium-4 medium-cell-block" style="background-color: aqua;">
              <p style="width:80vw;">A medium 4 cell block... on medium this content should overflow and let you horizontally scroll across... one might use this for an array of options</p>
            </div>
            <div class="cell medium-4" style="background-color: cornflowerblue;">
              This text was made using the same thing except instead of medium-4 it is medium-8.  Thus it takes up 8 columns.
            </div>
