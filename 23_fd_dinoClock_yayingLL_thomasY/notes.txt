DISCO
- You can manually set the sizes for each cell in a grid at three breakpoints (small, medium, large)
	- Bootstrap has set sizes for breakpoints
- Grid padding x and grid padding y are automatic
- Grid x refers to a row of cells
	- If too long will snap to the next line
- Grid y refers to a column of cells
	- Snaps based on window width, not window height
	- Maintains set height for the entire grid (changes cell height)
