K09 -- Basic Exploration into Flask
2021-10-03

Q0:
- This is similar to using a constructor to initialize and object in Java
- Java -> objectName = objectType(parameterForConstructor)
- This would mean that we are creating a Flask object that is named app.

Q1:
- @app.route("/") contains the word route, therefore it may be related to the path of the app
- This could be the url which the app is related to

Q2:
- This will print to the terminal when you run the app
* What was printed:
  * Serving Flask app 'app' (lazy loading)
  * Environment: production
    WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
    Use a production WSGI server instead.
  * Debug mode: off
  * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit) -> This contains the url of the website
    * The url is a blank website with the words "No hablo queso!"
    * url is the same despite being on different machines
* After quitting the app/program, __main__ is printed (think this was print(__name__) )

Q3:
- print(__name__) will print whatever __name__ is set to by default
* By default __name__ is set to __main__
- "No hablo queso!" will appear at the end destination of the route, which would be a website that is created when the program is run.

Q4:
- We have seen similar constructs in Java
- When running a function from another class or object
- className.function(parameters) and objectName.function(parameters)

Notables:
* Could not use python3 to run app.py
