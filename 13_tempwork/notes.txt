K13: Template for Success
2021-10-12

Flask
* Can have multiple routes in one app.
* Good to have a home page.
  * If there is no default route ("/") the central webpage returns Not Found.
* Can iterate through a dictionary in the template with Jinja2.

Egoless Programming
* Working with others is beneficial.
* Don't be afraid to have others look at your code for errors. Don't look at code reviews as attacks.
* Outside eyes are useful for looking for bugs.
  * Interesting that we get used to our coding styles which causes us to skip over clear bugs and mistakes.
* Reading somebody else's code could benefit your own.
  * Learn where mistakes are made. Could be the same issues for your own code.
