K08 - Virtual Environments
2021-09-30

Observations
- $ python3 -m venv ~/myherozero -> the command creates a virtual environemnt with the name myherozero as the directory.
- There are 3 folders (Include, Lib, and Scripts) and a config file
- The Include folder is empty. What is this folder for?
- The Lib folder contains site-packages
  - Where you would install specific libraries for the virtual environment
- Scripts Folder
  - The folder that actually has Python
  - Used to activate and deactivate the virtual environment
- python3 -> only entering python3 in your terminal opens the python environment, where you can run piece of python code.
- python3 -m -> this command allows python to find a module or a python file and run it from the command line.

- $ myherozero/Scripts/activate -> activates the virtual environment
- $ deactivate -> closes the virtual environment
- Virtual environments have their own directories
  - Can have its own independent set of installed Python packages
  - Can have virtual enviroments of different Python versions
  - Allows you to run python applications that may need different versions of python.
