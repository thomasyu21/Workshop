- What is the best implementation for weighted randomized selection?
- Many groups used DictReader, but many also did not
  - Some groups only used csv.reader
  - One group read in the data using the url of the github percentages
  - Others read in the data and separated the Job Class from the Percentages manually.
- Some groups used random.choices to do the weighted randomized selection
  - How does random.choices work?
- It doesn't matter if you multiply the percentages by 10 and used randint or if you just used random
