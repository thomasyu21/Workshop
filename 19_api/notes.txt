- The JSON in the browser is formatted nicely to separate the key value pairs.
- In the raw data, each key and value is separated by a colon and each key value pair is separated by a comma.

- Uses a GET request to create the HTTP response

- urlopen opens a HTTP response
- json.loads() takes in a string -> gives error when feeding in the HTTP response
- json.load() will take in the HTTP response
