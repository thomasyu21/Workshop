MongoDB 101 Chapter 1
NoSQL Database
- No related tables of data
- Data stored instead as documents
	- Documents stored in collections

Document: a way to organize and store data as a set of field-value pairs
	- Like a dictionary
{
	<field> : <value>
}
Collection: multiple documents (usually with a common field between them)
Database: multiple collections

Atlas
- Use to set up database in the cloud
Clusters: Group of servers
Replica Set: multiple MongoDB instances that store the same data (redundant data)
Instance: single machine (locally or in the cloud) running a certain software
- If one instance fails, the data will still be maintained by the other instance
