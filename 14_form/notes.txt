K14: Form and Function
2021-10-14

Observations before running:
- disp_loginpage() starts by printing out three new lines, then a line of text.
- Then, it prints app, but what does printing the app do? Will it print the name of the app object that was declared?
- What is request? How is it being printed in the terminal? Can it be printed even if it is not declared?
- App prints request.args, but there are no arguments present? (unless there are default arguments)
- Prints request.headers, but we don't know what request.headers is.
- Then, disp_loginpage() ends by displaying the login template.

authenticate():
- Has the exact same code as disp_loginpage(), except that it returns "Waaaa hooo HAAH".

login.html:
- Where in the code does it take us to another page? How is this done?
- Username seems to be the argument in request.args.
- After submit, the html file triggers authenticate(), taking you to a page returning "Waaaa hooo HAAH".

After running:
disp_loginpage():
- print(app) returns <Flask 'app'>
- print(request) returns the address to the webpage.
- print(request.args) returns an empty dictionary
- print(request.headers) returns a lot of info from the user (such as the browser that is accessing the webpage).

authenticate():
- The address changes to include the new route, as well as information submitted from the form on the previous page.
- request.args has new information added to the dictionary, which includes the username and sub1.
