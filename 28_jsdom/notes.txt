- console.log() in the js file will print things to the browser console
- can only call functions after they have been initialized in the file
- local variables exists in js

- running functions in the js file will cause them to affect the HTML
- knows what document is being referred to as it is called in index.html via the script tag

- is there any way to change classes declared in the HTML file?
- why does script() override the text color of red() but the opposite isn't the case?

GCD function
- takes the lower of the two numbers and tests if it is the GCD
  - if not try the number 1 less than that (goes down to 1)
- by no means is fast
