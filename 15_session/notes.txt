Dev Console:
Favicon Error:
When requesting data, the FireFox console returns a favicon exception
Says Favicon at http://127.0.0.1:5000/favicon.ico failed to load because it was not found

Then it says Unchecked lastError value -> could not establish connection.
These errors can be ignored as the webpage still works as intended.

Warning:
LoginRecipes: getRecipes: falling back to a synchronous message for: http://127.0.0.1:5000
Shows up in the console whenever the form is submitted

Drop down for GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/favicon.ico:
Says status is 404 NOT FOUND
No cookies or request payload
Has information about response and request headers.
- Content length, type, date, server (Werkzeug), host, etc.

TO DO:
make new templates depending on if username/password is incorrect
finish conditional checks
probably need to use request.cookies.get('username") to establish a session if the user is logged in/has logged in previously
comments!
note more dev console stuff
