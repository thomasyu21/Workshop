Dev Console:
Favicon Error:
When requesting data, the FireFox console returns a favicon exception
Says Favicon at http://127.0.0.1:5000/favicon.ico failed to load because it was not found

Then it says Unchecked lastError value -> could not establish connection.
These errors can be ignored as the webpage still works as intended.

TypeError: gRecipeManager is null
- What is gRecipeManager?
- Doesn't stop the webpage from working/

Warning:
LoginRecipes: getRecipes: falling back to a synchronous message for: http://127.0.0.1:5000
Shows up in the console whenever the form is submitted

Drop down for GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/favicon.ico:
Says status is 404 NOT FOUND
No cookies or request payload
Has information about response and request headers.
- Content length, type, date, server (Werkzeug), host, etc.

Cookies:
When there is no session, the drop down for GET <url> has no cookies or requests
Upon successful login: Response Cookies
- httpOnly: true
- path: "/"
- value = <Very Long String>
- request is still empty
When user accesses session by going to the login page: Request Cookies
- session = <Very Long String From Before>
When the user logs out of the session: Both Response and Request Cookies
- expires: "1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
- value is now ""
Session value changes every time the session is created
The expiration value remains the same
Beginning of value seems to be the same for every session: "eyJ1c2VyIjoiVXNlcm5hbWUifQ.YW"
- The rest of the string changes (alphanumeric except for one '.')
Don't really understand what app.secret_key does, but without it says the session was unavailable due the lack of a secret key.

Error Handling:
Used conditionals to determine if the username and password are correct.
Also used conditionals to check if there is a session.
Didn't use any other exception handling. (Don't know if webpage is guaranteed to not fail)
