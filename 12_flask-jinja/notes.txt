Q0: If render_template is removed, there would be nothing to refer to when returning render_template()
* With Debugger mode on:
* The webpage shows NameError
* Shows the traceback to where the error occurs in the code
* With Debugger mode off:
* Internal Server Error
* Either the server is overloaded or there is an error in the application.

Q1: https://localhost:5000/template/my_foist_template
* This was incorrect
* http://127.0.0.1:5000/my_foist_template is the actual url
* app.route() replaces the path of the file in the url, not just the file itself

Q2: 'model_tmplt.html' refers to the file, foo variable replaces the title with the string.
- Expected Behavior:
- Website title becomes fooooo
* This can be observed in the name of the tab itself, not on the webpage
- The body would return the elements in coll with a newline/break after each element
* Did in fact return the list with an element per line

Things to Note:
- http://127.0.0.1:5000/ still shows the webpage with "No hablo queso!"
- What is the specific syntax for Jinja2
	- What exactly do % and {} represent
