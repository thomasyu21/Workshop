K31 -- canvas based JS animation
2022-02-16

requestID is an integer
- return value of requestAnimationFrame
 
requestAnimationFrame(callback)
- callback = function you want to run again

cancelAnimationFrame(requestID)
- stops the animation frame based on the requestID associated with the frame

window refers to the browser window
- requestAnimationFrame and cancelAnimationFrame work even without "window." in front

if (requestID) {
    window.cancelAnimationFrame(requestID);
}
- Checks if requestID is undefined (you are running it again)
- Stops the animation from speeding up
