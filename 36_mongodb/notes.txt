MongoDB 101 Chapter 2
STORING DATA
Subdocument: document as a value within a document
JSON (JS Object Notation)
- Pros: user friendly, readable, familiar
- Cons: text-based, space-consuming, limited in types

BSON = Binary JSON
- optimized for speed, space, and flexibility
- Encoding in binary instead of UTF-8 String
- More data types than JSON (Date, raw binary)
- readable by machine only

Data stored by MongoDB in BSON
 - Can be viwed in JSON format

Interacting with the Atlas Cluster
Choosing data type -> based on what readability you need (human or machine)
- Export
  - BSON: mongodump --uri "<Atlas Cluster URI>"
  - JSON: mongoexport --uri "<Atlas Cluster URI>"
                      --collection=<collection name>
                      --out=<filename>.json
- Import:
  - BSON: mongorestore --uri "<Atlas Cluster URI>"
                       --drop dump
 - JSON: mongoimport --uri "<Atlas Cluster URI>"
                     --drop=<filename>.json

URI = Uniform resource identifier
srv: establishes a secure network
- Atlas Cluster URI: mongodb+srv://user:password@cluserURI.mongodb.net/database
- default database name is test

DATA EXPLORER (query in GUI)
- Namespace = collection name + document name separated by period
- Find tab = preview of what is in the document (20 at a time)
Querying: Insert valid JSON query in filter field (find tab)

FIND COMMAND (query in shell)
mongo "mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster>.mongodb.net/admin" (connect to db)
show dbs (lists databases in the cluster)
use <collection name> (indiciate you will be working with specific db)
show collections (lists collections in db)
db.<document name>.find( <JSON query> )
  - shows at max 20 documents
  - it command to iterates through a cursor (shows next 20 documents)
    - cursor = pointer to a result set of a query
      - pointer = direct address to memory location
.count() operation counts number of documents
.pretty() operation formats documents to be easier to read
***No query = just shows any 20 documents from the collection
